# HomeStars FrontEnd Features

## Completed Features

- Can sign up
- Can login
- Can create a new channel
- Can add a new message to a channel
- Can search GIFS, (outside of normal flow of webpages, need to manually go to /gifSearch)

## Notes

- There was so much time spent on the back end, that this front-end is barebones in terms of styling and features.
- Whereas the backend has the code as a CRUD application to support more features, the front-end needs more work.
- Also, like described in the Back-End README, a lot of time was spent trying to create a LIVE chat app, but it didn't work in time.

## FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS

- Make it into a LIVE chat app with websockets
- By virtue of that, any changes are listened to and handled on the front-end, meaning, no need to reload to see new data
- Lots more styling
- More error handling
- Adding tests
- Implementing the ability to search a GIF, add it to a message, and in the message list, if GIF, display the GIF
- Implement editing and deleting of messages
- Implement archiving of channels
- Create a place to display statistics
